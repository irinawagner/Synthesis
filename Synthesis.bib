  abstract = {This report, arising from a study of affiliation and disaffiliation in interaction, addresses an apparently 'anomalous' finding in relation to complaint sequences in conversation. In some of the cases we collected in which one speaker was complaining on behalf of the other (their co-participant), taking her side in some matter, the one on whose behalf the other was complaining did not affiliate with the complaint. Instead they resisted the complaint (again, one made on their behalf) and demurred to 'go so far'. This finding is anomalous in the sense that if A is complaining on behalf of B, in respect of some harm done to B, then it might be expected that B would go along with the complaint, and affiliate with A. To account for how it might come about that B demurs from 'going as far as' A, we explore how complaints are frequently introduced in conversation. We show that complaints may emerge through a progression in which 'the complainant' does not initially go on record with a complaint, but instead secures the other's participation in co-constructing the complaint. Hence the 'complaint recipient' may be the first to make the complaint explicit, in a sequence of escalating affiliation. In the 'anomalous' cases, it appears that this escalation goes too far for the putative complainant (B). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The study follows an identities-in-interaction approach and attends to the occurrence of identity claims in stories of recent mediated interactions (e.g. on MSN, by text) between tellers and male suitors, which I collectively call small stories. In a narrative-interactional analysis of such claims in two small stories, I postulate a distinction between taleworld and telling identity claims that allows me to show how the sequential context of the claims has implications for their interactional uptake. I specifically focus on the relational organization of the identity claims in contrastive pairs of positive and negative attributes and on their contribution to the stories' tellership rights and tellability. My main aim is to show how identity claims can be intimately linked with and discursively invoke solidified roles (cf. known, habitual) that hold above and beyond the local context. I argue that the three interactional features of iterativity, narrativity and stylization hold the key to uncovering the links between identity claims with solidified roles.},

  abstract = {This article examines how so-called ordinary or casual conversational prac- tices in the contemporary United States are constrained and structured in terms of where, when, how, and with whom people choose and are able to interact socially. The focus of analysis is the middle-class sociolinguistic practice of ``coffeetalk'' \textendash{} a term borrowed from U.S. popular culture to signal the naturalized conflation of conversation with the commercialized consumption of coffee, space, and other commodities. The discussion of coffeetalk involves research methods including critical analyses of the mar- keting rhetoric of coffeehouse corporations; informal interviews with cof- feehouse owners, employees and patrons; and the author's observations as a ``native'' participant in coffeetalk and other commodified modes of middle- class social interaction. By situating coffeetalk within its spatial, temporal and social contexts, this analysis challenges the claim of some sociolinguists that conversation is a ``naturally occurring'' phenomenon that is ontologi- cally prior to other speech genres.Asystematic investigation of the material and social dimensions of seemingly ordinary conversational practices dem- onstrates that these are inextricably implicated in the political, economic, and cultural-ideological processes of global capitalism, as symbolized by the increasingly ubiquitous Starbucks Coffee Company.

  abstract = {Heterosexism has become a recognized social problem since the rise of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) activism in the 1970s. One of its manifestations is heteronormativity: the mundane production of heterosexuality as the normal, natural, taken-for-granted sexuality. My research uses conversation analysis to explore heteronormativity as an ongoing, situated, practical accomplishment by people oriented to other actions entirely. I show that family reference terms\textemdash{}across a dataset of 59 after-hours calls to the doctor\textemdash{}are deployed so as to construct a normative version of the heterosexual nuclear family: a married couple, co-resident with their biological, dependent children. I examine the inferences normatively attached to family reference terms, consider how these inferences are used interactionally, and document how this everyday talk-in-interaction both reflects and reconstitutes the culturally normative definition of the family. This research advances our understanding of normativity by showing how a social problem can exist even when there is no orientation to ``trouble'' in interaction. Here, the persistent and untroubled reproduction of a taken-for-granted heteronormative world both reflects heterosexual privilege and (by extrapolation) perpetuates the oppression of non-heterosexual people, denied access to key social institutions such as marriage and unable to take for granted access to their culture's family reference terms. The article shows how the heteronormative social order is reproduced at the level of mundane social interaction, through the everyday conversational practices of ordinary folk.},

I show that the name-quoting descriptor is used for claiming the referent's ``epistemic distance,'' i.e., for claiming that the referent is not within the shared territory of knowledge between speaker and recipient, and thereby carries out several interactional tasks in addition to referring. This finding contributes to research on reference practices and epistemics. Data are in Japanese with English translation.},

Focusing on first and second person subjects, the current study details the role of their overt use in conversations, and shows that in addition to the function in discourse contexts, such as 'contrastiveness' and 'emphasis', the overt expression of first and second person subjects is a useful tool to index the speaker's social relationship with the other participant, such as social difference or intimacy. This is particularly important for a group of pro-drop languages like Japanese and Korean, in which the expression of difference is the norm and a variety of personal references play a significant role in expressing such difference, as well as intimacy. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It be-gins with a critical review of the way genre has been used in linguistic an-thropology. A distinction is delineated between approaches that take for granted the status of genre as a tool for classifying and ordering discourse and those that contend with elements of generic ambiguity and dynamism. Proceeding to outline a new approach to genre, the discussion analyzes a wide range of intertextual relations that are deployed in constituting generic links. A series of examples contrasts strategies for minimizing gaps between texts and generic precedents with strategies for maximizing such gaps. A final section points to the ways that investigating generic intertextuality can illuminate questions of ideology, political economy, and power.

The aim here is to give voice to, and advance understanding for, stories that do not fit this canon and are thus in the fringes of narrative research. Examples of such stories are brought in from two communication contexts (adolescents' conversations \textendash{} private email messages) and their interactional features of ongoing-ness, intertextuality and recontextualization are documented. The issues that are then addressed on their basis involve the ways in which mainstream conceptualization of narrative analysis (e.g. tellership, tellability, embeddedness) can be revised and stretched to reach out to those cases; also, the implications for narrative cum identity research.},

The data consist of recordings of counselling sessions offered to children whose parents are in the process of separation or divorce. The os- tensible aim of the servicewas to provide normalizing interventions rather than deal- ing with clinical referrals. The focus of the article is on the practice of what is known in counselling psychology as active listening. This refers to the ways in which coun- sellors seek to showresponsivity to what the child is saying. Based on analysis of nat- urally occurring child counselling talk, this article shows how the conversational practice of formulation is utilized to achieve some of the complex interactionalwork involved in active listening.},

  abstract = {This paper represents part of the output of an ongoing study of clusters of phonetic parameters in the management of talk-in-interaction. Here we report on the sequential organisation and phonetic form of abrupt-joins. By abrupt-join we mean to adumbrate a complex of recurrent phonetic events which attend a point of possible turn-completion, and the beginning of an immediately subsequent turn-constructional unit (TCU) produced by that same speaker. In doing an abrupt-join, the speaker can be seen to preempt the transition relevance and interactional implicativeness of the first unit. The phonetic features which constitute this practice include duration, rhythm, pitch, loudness and articulatory characteristics of both the end of the first unit and the beginning of the second. Abrupt-joins are a resource used in the building of a particular kind of multi-unit turn, where each unit performs a discrete action with the abrupt-join marking the juncture between them, with the subsequent talk changing the sequential trajectory projectable from the talk leading up to the abrupt-join. One clear distributional pattern emerges from the data: abrupt-joins occur regularly in closing-relevant and topic-transition sequences. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Drawing on examples from both face-to-face talk and public discourse, she analyses a variety of repairs, reformulations of referents, and retellings of narratives, ranging from word-level repairs within a single turn-at-talk, to life story narratives told years apart. Bringing together work from conversation analysis, interactional sociolinguistics, cognitive semantics, pragmatics, and variation analysis, In Other Words will be invaluable for scholars wishing to understand the many different factors that underlie the shaping and re-shaping of discourse over time, place and person.},

  abstract = {Prior conversation analytic research has demonstrated that when, following a sequence-initiating action, a response is relevantly missing (or is forthcoming but is apparently inadequate), speakers may use a range of practices for pursuing a response (or a more adequate response). These practices?such as response prompts, preference reversals, or turn extensions?treat the missing (or inadequate) response as indicative of some problem, and they may either expose or mask the response pursuit and the problem they attempt to remediate. This article extends this prior research by showing that speakers can also use repair technology?specifically, repair of an indexical reference?as a resource for pursuing a response. It demonstrates that speakers can use repair of indexicals, particularly when no uncertainty as to the referent seems possible, in order to pursue a response while obscuring some other possible source of trouble. Initiating repair on an indexical reference in transition space claims that a missing response is due to a problem of understanding or of recognizing the reference, and by repairing it, the speaker makes available another opportunity for a response without exposing recipient disinclination as the possible source of the trouble. Likewise, repairing an indexical reference in the third turn can pursue a more adequate response, while avoiding going on record as doing so, by treating the sequence-initiating turn as the source of the trouble. We show that, by ostensibly dealing with problems of reference, repairs on indexicals manage (covertly) other more interactionally charged issues, such as upcoming disagreement or misalignment between interlocutors.},

I will thus propose small stories research as a ``new'' narrative turn that can provide a needed meeting point for narrative analysis and narrative inquiry.},

I demonstrate how participants, by engaging in complaining about someone who is physically present, exclude that person from participating in the interaction and from defending herself against the accusations entailed in the complaint. Focusing on video-recorded data from Danish home help visits, I show how the institutional roles of the participants affect the way in which such complaints develop. When a caregiver initiates a complaint about the care recipient other caregivers immediately affiliate with the complaint. Such complaints are successful because the caregivers agree to treat the target of the complaint, the care recipient, as a non-ratified participant. By contrast, when the care recipient initiates complaints about a caregiver the caregiver's colleague rejects the complaint. Such complaints are unsuccessful because the exclusion of the target of the complaint fails. These results suggest that participation is constituted through and influenced by the social roles we have and the social activities we engage in as members of society. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced.

  abstract = {This book explores person markers, the linguistic elements that provide points of reference to speech-act participants. Michael Cysouw develops a new framework for the typology of person marking based on the rejection of the notion of plurality for its analysis. When a mother says "Mummy is going to say goodnight now", Mummy is the person marker in a way that in English is confined to motherese but which is used more commonly in some other languages and may also be characteristic of much earlier forms. Dr Cysouw divides the person markers of 400 languages into paradigms. He considers how the structure of these person paradigms relates to their function. His investigation provides a clear account of how person markers work syntactically, pragmatically, and semantically as well as giving freshinsights into aspects of linguistic change, language-relatedness, and the interfaces between discourse, syntax, and semantics. The combination of a typological and a comparative approach results in the first outline of a cognitive map of the paradigmatic structure of person marking.},

  abstract = {(Im)politeness is usually discussed in context of an ongoing discourse situation. In this article, I show that relational work is not limited to a single conversation: specifically, the impact of a face attack can carry over to subsequent conversations. During a face attack, one of the options for the hearer is to remain silent, not defending his/her face (Culpeper, 1996:354). This option might be used when the offender is significantly more powerful than the hearer; the power differential sharply restricts the hearer's options for defending face (Culpeper et al., 2003:1562; Austin, 1990:279; Bousfield and Locher, 2008:8-9). However, in some cases the hearer does not simply accept the damage to his/her face. Unable to confront the offender directly, the offended restores face by complaining to peers and soliciting their commiseration and approval. Using Modern Russian data, I show how an offensive conversation between two interlocutors (usually a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law) is recycled when the offended later complains at an online support group. The complainer often uses a special construction with subject ellipsis to introduce the reported offensive discourse. By using this construction, the offended retroactively and symbolically attacks the offender, thus repairing damage to face. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

More specifically, the intent is to examine the form taken by the complaint and the form of the response elicited from the hearer, and to bring out the relation between the complaint as an act and the argument as a genre of conversation. The complaints analyzed, taken from a corpus of family conversations recorded in Montr{\'e}al, have preferential realization patterns that can be linked in part to the intimacy of the relationship between the interactants: In many ways, they are uttered without the special precautions generally associated with face-threatening acts. The complainees most often reject the blame leveled at them. But well characterized arguments are virtually absent from the corpus. The entry into the argument is negotiated in the speech turns that follow the complaint/response sequence, and the argument only breaks out if the complainer questions the value of the complainee's response. Both interactants use numerous strategies for avoiding an argument and, more often than not, they succeed. The strategies they use can be seen as indicators of the status of verbal confrontation in the Qu{\'e}bec community.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on some recent work on affectivity, or emotive involvement, in conversational storytelling. After presenting the approach, some case studies of the display and management of affectivity in storytelling in telephone and face-to-face conversations are presented. The analysis reconstructs the display and handling of affectivity by both storyteller and story recipient. In particular, I describe the following kinds of resources: - the verbal and segmental display: Rhetorical, lexico-semantic, syntactic, phonetic-phonological resources; - the prosodic and suprasegmental vocal display: Resources from the realms of prosody and voice quality; - visual or "multimodal" resources from the realms of body posture and its changes, head movements, gaze, and hand movements and gestures. It is shown that the display of affectivity is organized in orderly ways in sequences of storytelling in conversation. I reconstruct (a) how verbal, vocal and visual cues are deployed in co-occurrence in order to make affectivity in general and specific affects in particular interpretable for the recipient and (b) how in turn the recipient responds and takes up the displayed affect. As a result, affectivity is shown to be managed by teller and recipient in storytelling sequences in conversation, involving both the reporting of affects from the story world as well as the negotiation of in-situ affects in the here-and-now of the storytelling situation.},

This article examines some implications of that neglect, especially vis-a-vis small-scale, indigenous, "oral" societies. Drawing principally on Hopi examples, I argue that language rights discourse rests on a reflexivization of language and culture enhanced by globalism. Now reified, language becomes an allegory of ethnic identity. Preexisting sociolinguistic sensibilities get repositioned, for example, in Native Americancommunities in which language has hitherto been deployed as a technique of privacy and sovereignty, language rights ideology islogocentric and presumes a democratic, secular space of language use, conflicting with both privacy and performativity in Native linguisticvalues. And some linguistic usage reinforces social inequality, both transnationally and group-internally: Here, language rights contradict other human rights. Language rights discourse also requires anthropology to rethink its recent antipathy to the culture concept and to treat language and culture objectively.

  abstract = {This article presents an agentic theory of human development, adaptation, and change. The evolutionary emergence of advanced symbolizing capacity enabled humans to transcend the dictates of their immediate environment and made them unique in their power to shape their life circumstances and the courses their lives take. In this conception, people are contributors to their life circumstances, not just products of them. Social cognitive theory rejects a duality between human agency and social structure. People create social systems, and these systems, in turn, organize and influence people's lives. This article discusses the core properties of human agency, the different forms it takes, its ontological and epistemological status, its development and role in causal structures, its growing primacy in the coevolution process, and its influential exercise at individual and collective levels across diverse spheres of life and cultural systems.},

  abstract = {This paper considers instances of biliterate educational practice in contexts of indigenous language revitalization involving Quechua in the South American Andes, Guarani in Paraguay, and Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In these indigenous contexts of sociohistorical and sociolinguistic oppression, the implementation of multilingual language policies through multilingual education brings with it choices, dilemmas, and even contradictions in educational practice. I consider examples of such contentious educational practices from an ecological perspective, using the continua of biliteracy and the notion of voice as analytical heuristics. I suggest that the biliterate use of indigenous children's own or heritage language as medium of instruction alongside the dominant language mediates the dialogism, meaning-making, access to wider discourses, and taking of an active stance that are dimensions of voice. Indigenous voices thus activated can be a powerful force for both enhancing the children's own learning and promoting the maintenance and revitalization of their languages},

  abstract = {This article addresses the issue of how to develop a theory of interpretation of social action (discourse included) that takes into consideration culture-specific claims about intentions while simultaneously allowing for a pan-human, universal dimension of intentionality. It is argued that to achieve such a goal, it is necessary to agree on a basic definition of intentionality and on the conditions that allow for its investigation. After briefly discussing the limitations of applying an (English-based) narrow' notion of intention to the analysis of other languages and cultures, a more general and basic analytic notion of intentionality is proposed, that is, as aboutness (as defined by Husserl). By applying this more general notion of intentionality, we can then examine both the content of intentional acts and the conditions that allow for their study across cultural contexts through bracketing'. This is made possible by the social ontology of intentions, which is what enables the analysis of human conduct and its interpretation. Our methods and hypotheses must be evaluated over and against such an existential premise.},

  abstract = {Sahlins bases his account of Polynesian 'heroic history' partly on the fact that chiefs used the pronoun 'I' in reference to their whole group. Mosko (1992) argues that Sahlins's consequent emphasis on 'encompassment' as the modality of chiefly action is diametrically opposed to Strathern's on 'partibility', the effacement of parts of the person as a condition of action. Drawing on comparative material from the New Guinea Highlands, where big men also use 'I' for their whole group, and on Benveniste's and Urban's accounts of the meaning and use of personal pronouns, I argue instead that moments of both encompassment and partibility are inherent in language, corresponding to two distinct dimensions in which the pronouns are meaningful (the 'direct indexical' and the 'anaphoric'), and that close attention to the interaction between the two can yield new insights into the nature of personhood and social agency.

  abstract = {These reflections by Hualapai educator Lucille Jackson Watahomigie eloquently capture the mutually constitutive relationship between language and identity. "It is said that when the languages were created, language identified the people\textemdash{}who we are, where we came from, and where we are going," Watahomigie adds (1998, 6). This sentiment is widely shared among Native speakers. "My language, to me, . . . that's what makes me unique, that's what makes me Navajo, that's what makes me who I am," Navajo artist and educator Fred Bia maintains (McCarty 2002, 179). "When people spoke Dakota," William Harjo Lonefight states, "they understood where they belonged in relation to other people, to the natural world, and to the spiritual world" (Ambler 2004, 8). Reflecting on the resources within his Native Cheyenne, Richard Littlebear notes that "embedded in this language are the lessons that guide our daily lives. We cannot leave behind the essence of our being" (2004, 20). Yet this most ancient of gifts is in peril of vanishing forever, as fewer and fewer young people are socialized through the ancestral language each generation. Linguists estimate that prior to European contact, some 300 to 500 Native languages were spoken by the peoples indigenous to what is now the United States and Canada (Krauss 1998; McCarty and Watahomigie 2003, 84\textendash{}86; Zepeda and Hill 1992). More than 200 of those languages remain\textemdash{}testimony to the resistance and resilience of their speakers\textemdash{}but only 34 are still being naturally acquired as a first language by children (Krauss 1998). Put another way, fully 84 percent of all Indigenous languages in the United States and Canada have no new speakers to pass them on. Even those languages with a substantial number of child speakers are slipping away, as the residue of a genocidal and linguicidal past and the modern influences of English media, technology, and schooling take their toll. When even a single language falls silent, the world loses an irredeemable repository of human knowledge. The great linguist and language advocate Kenneth Hale, who spoke some seventy-five languages himself, put it this way: "Every language lost is like dropping a bomb on the Louvre" (Ambler 2004, 9). To speakers, the loss is more intimate, personal, and irretrievable. "If a child learns only English, you have lost your child," a Navajo elder states (McCarty 2002, 181; McCarty and Zepeda 1999, 207). "It is language that carries the nature and character of who we are and how we relate with one another . . . and to all things we experience in life," a Pueblo leader relates; "[o]nce we've lost that, we have lost everything" (Suina 2004, 300). Pecos and Blum-Martinez add that in many Native communities, the tribal language remains "the only viable means for sacred communication" (2001, 75). In the epigraph that begins this article, Watahomigie refers to the Native language as a gift. "When you are given a gift\textemdash{}especially one that is alive\textemdash{}it must be cherished, nurtured, and treated with respect to honor the giver" (Watahomigie 1998, 5). Similar metaphors can be found in tribal language policies: "The Yaqui language is a gift from Itom Achai, the Creator of our people," the Yaqui Tribal Language Policy begins, "and, therefore, shall be treated with respect" (Zepeda 1990, 250). When such a gift is compromised or threatened, the most important stakeholders are the young. Through the language socialization process, Romero writes, "understandings of essential information such as the values, precepts, and the belief systems [Native people] hold close to their hearts, are passed from one generation...},

  abstract = {Language shift from German-Hungarian bilingualism to the exclusive use of German is occurring in the community discussed. Young women are further along in the direction of this change than older people and young men. The linguistic contrast between German and Hungarian is shown to represent the social dichotomy between a newly available worker status and traditional peasant status; thus the choice of language in interaction is part of a speaker's presentation of self. Young women's stated preferences con- cerning this social dichotomy and their changing marriage strategies indicate that their greater use of German in interaction is one aspect of their general preference for the worker's way of life it symbolizes. Rather than simply isolating a linguistic correlate of sex, the present study suggests that women's speech choices must be explained within the context of their social position, their strategic life choices and the symbolic values of the available linguistic alternative.},

"Joking relationships": "a relation between two persons in which one is by custom permitted, and in some instances required, to tease or make fun of the other, who in turn is required to take no offence" (195). A mix of friendliness and antagonism, but not meant to be taken seriously (context important b/c outside of this such actions might provoke hostility). Two types: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Respect is an integral part of maintaining the social order. 1. Discusses how this work in terms of a man and woman marrying - social disjunction with family marrying into b/c have diverse interests which can create conflict and hostility. To avoid this potential problem, can have extremely formal (somewhat avoidant, though said to be based on extreme mutual respect) relations btwn the in-laws. The other option is the joking relationship, which is one of mutual disrespect and license. The relationship usually differs by generation - usually very respectful to first ascending generation and the joking relatives are one's own generation (though this might differ by seniority within the generation with more respect being shown the older siblings, for example). 2. Joking relationships can also exist between tribes and clans (199). B. Social Fx of showing respect to first ascending gen (asymmetrical relationship): social tradition handed down from one generation to the next and for this to be maintained, need authority. The second ascending gen though is often treated w/ much less respect - tendency toward friendly terms and relatively mild joking relationship. Grandchildren are entering as full participants in social life as their grandparents are retiring from it (202). Talks about how Fxs of different relatives are separated - fathers and his siblings often fill role of controlling and disciplining children (who show them respect and obedience), while mothers and her siblings often fill role of showing affection and assistance (mother's brother has joking relationship with her children - but relation is asymmetrical w/ nephew the superior, reversing usual power relation btwn generations - notes that nephew often referred to as grandchild, a legal fiction). (gives other examples of kinship systems and "legal fictions")},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 $\backslash$AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Widely recognized as a social problem in Japan, kodokushi (solitary death) stereotypically happens when old people living alone, detached from kin and neighbors, die alone without being noticed immediately, leaving the body to decompose. Reorganizing Japanese discourses of kinship, locality, and other modalities of ``connection'' (en), practices and projects concerning solitary death articulate an emergent fantasy of sociality. I analyze this fantasy as an ideology of communication that draws upon idioms of ``contact,'' or phaticity: ``touching-together'' (fureai), ``connecting'' (tsunagari), and so on. Due recognition of such an ideology reveals different ways in which sociality is understood in Japan today. Reclaiming the concept of phaticity through a more explicit theoretical metalanguage, I offer an exploration of the cultural concept of en to suggest that the condition of solitude transpires in an interstice between two qualitatively different chronotopes of sociality.},

Before Morgan the study of kinship terminology was embedded within a comparative study of core vocabularies to determine historic relations among nations (e.g. Leibniz). Morgan's breakthrough was to disembed the terms of kinship from the vocabulary list and conceptualize them as a set. His vision of their evolution had two phases. Before the revolutionary expansion of ethnological time in the mid-19th century, he developed an evolutionary view of the Indo-European kinship terminology that was very acute but tied to a short chronology for world history that the time revolution shortly exploded; after the time revolution he conceived the Iroquois and the English (as types of the Classificatory and the Descriptive) terminologies as an evolutionary series caused by successive reformations of the marriage rule. After Morgan, Dravidian and its structural neighbors have come to play the role of evolutionary starting-point. The article concludes with reasons to be skeptical of the current consensus and ways to move forward. Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd},

Focusing on two local categories used to conceptualize non-biological kinship (kizuna and en), this paper explores how durable relational ties are embodied through physical similarity and caring proximity. However, similarity is always haunted by difference: boundaries between family and non-family; made connections or ineffable, inherent ties; and visible markers of otherness, like ethnicity and race.},

Kinship has historically been central to the discipline of anthropology but what sort of future does it have? What is the impact of recent studies of reproductive technologies, of gender, and of the social construction of science in the West? What significance does public anxiety about the family, or new family forms in the West have for anthropology's analytic strategies? The study of kinship has rested on a distinction between the 'biological' and the 'social'. But recent technological developments have made this distinction no longer self-evident. What does this imply about the comparison of kinship institutions cross-culturally? Janet Carsten gives an approachable and original view of the past, present, and future of kinship in anthropology, which will be of interest not just to anthropologists but to social scientists generally.},

The phenomena under investigation include direct-style self-quotation, direct-style self-representation of thought, as well as direct-style quotative explanation. Using the closely related concepts of 'multivoicedness', 'text population' and 'interdiscursivity', this paper argues that self-quotation allows for manipulation of multiple voices in Japanese discourse. Also discussed is the function of certain types of self-quotation from the perspective of speech act qualification. It is pointed out that these functions are realized through the juxtaposition of semiotic contexts. Despite the fact that the concept of context has occupied an important place in pragmatics, the manipulation of the contexts for creating meaning has rarely been discussed. Although this study discusses the case of Japanese only, the potentially universal nature of multivoicedness in (self-)quotation and of the juxtaposition of semiotic contexts in language in general is suggested.},

First, the most prototypical forms of reported speech are discussed (direct and indirect speech); subsequently some less prototypical modes of report (free direct and indirect speech, as well as a number of hybrid constructions) are considered It is argued that these different constructions vary along two major parameters., direct versus indirect and framed versus free. It is therefore suggested that instead of representing different positions on a scale, these constructions are better regarded as occupying different slots in a matrix. In terms of FDG analysis, the difference between direct speech and indirect speech is shown to correspond to a difference in the type of entity denoted by the speech complement (a discourse act versus communicated content). The +/- frame distinction is reflected in the representation of the communicated content (fully expressed versus holophrastic). The even less prototypical constructions, too, are given their own analysis; it is demonstrated that these constructions occupy their own position in the matrix.},

Beginning with an examination of direct and indirect reported speech, it highlights some of the design features of the former, and the sequential environ- ments in which it occurs. Recent research on direct reported speech in interaction has shown that although it purports to be the accurate replaying of a former locu- tion, speakers can simultaneously convey their assessment of the utterance while reproducing it. This investigation focuses on how speakers implicitly comment on a reported utterance, exploring the design and sequential placement of the device within the ongoing talk. It is found that direct reported speech recurs in making complaints and telling amusing stories. In addition, explicit assessment of the reported utterance is made commonly by the recipient in the next turn, and the reporter often collaborates with the recipient's response by producing a similar one in overlap. Thus, participants react concurrently to the reported utterance.},

The study explores the relationship between agency, responsibility and participation from the perspective of reported speech. Drawing on data from dinner table conversations in Danish families, the study provides a qualitative analysis of two narratives about a problematic event in which the target child is involved. The analysis demonstrates that the participants do not separate agency from the speaker position in these embedded positions of participation; rather, agency and responsibility are invoked, made salient and negotiated in interactional processes and hence embedded in the organization of participation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The concepts of public and private expression designate two different levels of linguistic expression which correspond to two different functions of language. Public expression is the level of linguistic expression corresponding to the communicative function of language, whereas private expression is the level of linguistic expression corresponding to the noncommunicative, thought-expressing function of language. It is shown that this hypothesis, together with concepts called public and private self, gives a unified account of apparently complicated phenomena concerning reported speech in Japanese.},

In this paper, we have the somewhat ambitious aim of outlining an all-encompassing theory of quotation in (written) natural language. We first provide a na??ve but neutral definition of quotation - quotation is everything between a pair of quotation marks - followed by a brief typology. Then, we develop an account of quotation which relies mainly on pragmatic mechanisms in order to explain what role quotation marks play in achieving communicative ends of writers. Quotation marks, we argue, are best understood as minimal pragmatic markers that block the stereotypical interpretation of the expression they enclose. They thereby indicate that some alternative interpretation ought to be inferred. We then address some worries about our view in order to clarify the aim and scope of our proposal as well as some deep-rooted philosophical preconceptions about quotation. Finally, we present the results of a small corpus study which we consider a confirmation of the predictions our account makes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

I suggest that, contrary to their claims, on closer scrutiny, the authors' examples still rely on a narrower sense of locutionary cooperation, and that their discussion of uses of indirect speech when deniability is not required could be expanded by taking into account instances of off-record indirectness between intimates or members of different social groups, where indirect speech may serve to underline the interlocutors' common ground and/or to construct the speaker's identity. Finally, I propose that a multi-component theory of indirect speech may offer a more productive way of accounting for off-record indirectness as the outcome of several different, sometimes opposing, motivations. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The analysis is based on data of informal German conversations (dinner table conver- sations, coffee-break chats and telephone interactions) among friends and family members. Methods of interpretative sociolinguistics (Gumperz, 1982), conversation analysis and inter- actional analysis of prosody (Couper-Kuhlen and Selting, 1996) are used to investigate the devices which speakers use in order to evaluate the reconstructed utterances. It will be argued that speakers not only (re)construct past dialogues but that often in this process of 'de- and recontextualization' simultaneously communicate their evaluative perspective on the quoted utterances. The analysis will focus on the following questions: How do speakers communi- cate their point of view to the reported dialogues? Which prosodic means and devices of speech quality are used to communicate the speaker's perspective towards the quoted utter- ance as concordant or discordant? I shall argue that participants in everyday interactions also use poetic devices and polyphonic strategies described by Bakhtin (1981) as 'layering of voices'. In contrast to literary texts, 'polyphonic layering of voices' in everyday reported dia- logues is mainly achieved by means of prosody (Gtinthner, 1993).},

It addresses two interrelated issues: (i) What semantic and pragmatic factors are associated with the difference between ergative and non-ergative subject marking in languages where this is not strictly determined by whether the verb is grammatically transitive or intransitive; (ii) How are we to understand the grammatical relationship between verbs of speaking and the material they frame? In both languages that material behaves in some respects like a grammatical object. These locutionary objects differ among themselves in the extent to which they stand out as distinct speech events in relation to the framing one, and those differences are correlated with the presence or absence of ergative marking on the subject of the framing verb. I argue that Bunuba and Ku Waru optional ergative marking in this context can be accounted for by an extended version of Hopper and Thompson's notion of object individuation, in which the grammar treats the metalinguistic relationship between reported speech and that which reports it as analogous to that between Patient and Agent in canonical transitive clauses. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {When people speak, they often insinuate their intent indirectly rather than stating it as a bald proposition. Examples include sexual come-ons, veiled threats, polite requests, and concealed bribes. We propose a three-part theory of indirect speech, based on the idea that human communication involves a mixture of cooperation and conflict. First, indirect requests allow for plausible deniability, in which a cooperative listener can accept the request, but an uncooperative one cannot react adversarially to it. This intuition is supported by a game-theoretic model that predicts the costs and benefits to a speaker of direct and indirect requests. Second, language has two functions: to convey information and to negotiate the type of relationship holding between speaker and hearer (in particular, dominance, communality, or reciprocity). The emotional costs of a mismatch in the assumed relationship type can create a need for plausible deniability and, thereby, select for indirectness even when there are no tangible costs. Third, people perceive language as a digital medium, which allows a sentence to generate common knowledge, to propagate a message with high fidelity, and to serve as a reference point in coordination games. This feature makes an indirect request qualitatively different from a direct one even when the speaker and listener can infer each other's intentions with high confidence.},

The dialogic nature of reported speech is reflected in the reporting speaker's capacity to simultaneously assign a stance to and take a stance on the reported speaker and event. The current paper focuses on the relationship of the lexico-syntactic and the embodied features of enactments in stance taking. The paper adds to previous research the notion of reporting space, a frame for potential active multimodal involvement in the stance-taking activity by all participants of the telling event. The teller enacts a character's talk and embodiment in a virtual space and place of the telling, thus setting up a reporting space which allows further enactments from all participants of the storytelling event. The analyses of the examples show that recipients indeed make use of the reporting space provided by the teller and produce subsequent, fitting enactments. They make use of the reporting space, i.e. the reference points provided by the prior enactments, in producing such further enactments, which adds further elements to and elaborates the reporting space. The recipients tie their multimodal contributions to the reporting space by way of resonating lexico-syntactic, prosodic and embodied features. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

There are, however, ambiguous cases when a particular stretch of talk occurring after a quote is neither clearly separated from the quote nor clearly marked as being part of it. Such cases, referred to in this study as 'fading out,' appear to have specific interactional functions allowing the speaker to deal with several potential problems.

Resources dependent on sequential position to index stance are deemed to be interactional evidentials to distinguish them from the well-documented stand-alone evidentials. Interactional and stand-alone evidentials, as forms of deixis, are directed to the orientations of epistemic authority and accountability respectively; their distinct means of marking evidentiality are grounded in the motivation to be explicit with regard to accountability and inexplicit with regard to authority.},

  abstract = {Traditional syntactic accounts of speech-reporting presuppose an original utterance and a set of decontextualized operations which transform direct into indirect speech. Pragmatic and discourse-pragmatic accounts of speech reporting analyze its functions in situated discourse and emphasize its rhetorical nature. The vast majority of analyses of speech reporting, whether from within linguistics, pragmatics or literary theory presuppose a narrative discourse frame. Certain types of narrative discourse (autobiography and narratives of personal experience) naturalize the notion of the original utterance, since the narrative purports to represent or re-present historical or biographical incident. In contrast, the occurrence of direct speech in non-narrative discourse unmasks or foregrounds the constructed, rhetorical nature of direct speech 'reporting' in these discourse contexts. In this paper, I present speech report data from non-narrative contexts in classroom discourse and examine the implications of this data for our understanding of the phenomenon of speech reporting, arguing for situated accounts of speech reporting which are sensitive to discourse context. Earlier versions of this paper were given at the Lancaster Linguistics Circle and as a poster at the 4th International Pragmatics Conference in Kobe, Japan. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer, whose insightful comments greatly improved some aspects of the analysis presented.},

The data consist of recordings of counselling sessions offered to children whose parents are in the process of separation or divorce. The os- tensible aim of the servicewas to provide normalizing interventions rather than deal- ing with clinical referrals. The focus of the article is on the practice of what is known in counselling psychology as active listening. This refers to the ways in which coun- sellors seek to showresponsivity to what the child is saying. Based on analysis of nat- urally occurring child counselling talk, this article shows how the conversational practice of formulation is utilized to achieve some of the complex interactionalwork involved in active listening.},
